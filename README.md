# Sports Roster

## Description

Sports Roster is the first React application that interacts with fireabse that I have created outside of class.  The application complete full CRUD on a single collection of players.  The user can view players on their team once they are logged in.  They can add new players to their team, remove players they no longer wish to keep, and update current players.  The form to create and update players will show and hide as it is needed.

## Technologies Used

- React
- Sass
- Bootstrap
- Firebase
